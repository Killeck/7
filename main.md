My first attempt to draw up the first floor, focusing on the flow of the house as well as trying to keep as much of the property connected so that it will become a suitable playground for our kid.

Redrawn plan for the first floor, to reduce building cost and dead space in multiple rooms (hallway, kitchen, main bedroom and connected walk-in). Extending second bedroom by reducing the internal hallway leading to the room

Floorplan for the basement. Not sure this will work as a substructure without proper pillars to support the 1st floor. Including a 60 square meter flat for renting on the north end of the house.
